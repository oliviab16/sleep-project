        <h1>Sleep Patterns and Academic Performance Among College Students</h1>
        <p>A data visualization project exploring the relationship between sleep habits and academic achievement</p>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>In recent years, sleep has become an increasingly discussed topic, especially in the context of college students' well-being. Sleep is vital for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and physical health, yet many students struggle to get adequate rest due to academic pressures, social life, and extracurricular activities. The purpose of this project was to explore the sleep habits of students at Northeastern University and identify any external factors that may influence sleep hygiene. By understanding these factors, the study could offer valuable insights into how lifestyle and academic demands affect sleep quality and quantity. This topic is relevant to both students and university staff because improving sleep habits could enhance students' overall health, productivity, and well-being.</p>
        
        <p>Our key research questions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do sleep patterns vary throughout the week for college students?</li>
            <li>Is there a correlation between sleep quality and academic performance (GPA)?</li>
            <li>How does screen time before bed affect sleep quality?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Through interactive visualizations, we explore these questions and aim to provide evidence-based insights that could help students make informed decisions about their sleep habits.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-description">
        <h2>About the Data</h2>
        <p>This study utilizes a comprehensive dataset collected from 100 college students through a voluntary survey conducted during the Spring semester. The dataset contains 41 variables covering various aspects of students' lives including:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demographic information:</strong> Age, gender, height, weight, academic year, and major</li>
            <li><strong>Academic factors:</strong> GPA, class credits, homework hours, and co-op/internship details</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep patterns:</strong> Sleep and wake times for each day of the week</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep quality:</strong> Self-reported on a scale of 1-5</li>
            <li><strong>Technology usage:</strong> Daily screen time, phone usage before bed</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle factors:</strong> Caffeine intake, housing situation, roommates</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The data was collected through an anonymous online survey with appropriate consent procedures, and all personal identifiers were removed prior to analysis. The dataset comprises approximately 4,100 data points (100 students × 41 variables), providing a rich foundation for exploring the complex interrelationships between sleep and academic performance.</p>

        <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>
        
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <h3>1. Sleep Duration Throughout the Week (D3.js)</h3>
            <div class="vis-description">
                <p>This interactive visualization shows the average sleep duration by day of the week, highlighting differences between weekdays and weekends. The color coding makes it easy to identify patterns across the week.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="filter-controls">
                <label for="coop-filter">Filter by:</label>
                <select id="coop-filter">
                    <option value="all">All Students</option>
                    <option value="classes">Classes Only</option>
                    <option value="coop">Co-op Only</option>
                </select>
            </div>
            <div class="vis-content">
                <!-- Keep the original D3 visualization -->
                <div id="d3-visualization"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="findings">
                <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
                <p>Sleep duration was relatively consistent throughout the week, with a noticeable increase on weekends (Saturday and Sunday, shown in orange). This pattern likely reflects students' ability to sleep in more on weekends when they don't have early morning classes or work commitments. The weekday consistency suggests that students maintain somewhat regular sleep schedules during the academic/work week.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <h3>2. Sleep Duration vs. GPA (Altair)</h3>
            <div class="vis-description">
                <p>This scatter plot explores the relationship between average sleep duration and academic performance measured by GPA. The correlation coefficient (r = -0.016) indicates almost no linear relationship between sleep duration and GPA in our sample, suggesting that other factors may be more influential for academic performance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="vis-content">
                <!-- Use iframe for the second visualization with custom height -->

            </div>
            <div class="findings">
                <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
                <p>Our analysis shows a very weak correlation between sleep duration and GPA, with a correlation coefficient of only -0.016. This suggests that, contrary to popular belief, simply getting more sleep may not directly translate to better academic performance. Other factors such as study habits, course difficulty, and individual learning styles likely play more significant roles in determining academic success.</p>

        <div class="visualization-container">
            <h3>3. Box Plots Comparing Sleep Hours Across Different Factors</h3>
            <div class="vis-description">
                <p>These box plots show the distribution of average daily sleep hours across different factors: roommate situation, academic program (co-op vs. classes), gender, and academic year. The box plots help identify how these factors might relate to sleep patterns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="vis-content">
                <!-- Use iframe for the third visualization with custom height -->

            </div>
            <div class="findings">
                <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
                <p>Our box plot analysis revealed that most demographic and living situation factors do not significantly affect sleep duration. However, we did observe that co-op status had the most notable impact—students on co-op tend to get more sleep on average than students taking classes. This could be attributed to the more structured nature of work schedules compared to the variable demands of academic coursework and exams.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <h3>4. Caffeine Intake vs. Sleep Hours (With Sleep Quality Filter)</h3>
            <div class="vis-description">
                <p>This interactive visualization explores the relationship between caffeine intake and average sleep duration. The slider allows you to filter the data based on sleep quality ratings. This helps analyze whether caffeine consumption impacts sleep duration differently for students with different sleep quality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="vis-content">
                <!-- Use iframe for the fourth visualization with custom height -->
                <iframe src="caffeine_vs_sleepduration_scatter.html" class="visualization-iframe caffeine-chart" scrolling="no"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class="findings">
                <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
                <p>The interactive scatter plot between caffeine intake and sleep duration allows exploration of patterns across academic disciplines. Using the sleep quality filter reveals that some students maintain good sleep quality despite high caffeine consumption, while others struggle with sleep quality even with low caffeine intake. This suggests individual differences in caffeine sensitivity may play a role in how it affects sleep patterns among college students.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <h3>5. Correlation Heatmaps: Comparing Co-op and Class Students</h3>
            <div class="vis-description">
                <p>These heatmaps show the correlations between different factors related to sleep and academic performance, separately for Co-op and Class students. This visualization helps identify whether relationships between factors differ between students in different academic programs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="vis-content">
                <!-- Use iframe for the fifth visualization with custom height -->
                <iframe src="heatmap_side_by_side.html" class="visualization-iframe heatmaps" scrolling="no"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class="findings">
                <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
                <p>Our correlation heatmaps demonstrate which factors have stronger or weaker impacts on sleep duration and quality. The most notable finding was that screen time had the strongest negative correlation with both sleep quality and sleep duration. This suggests that excessive screen usage, particularly before bedtime, may be a significant factor affecting college students' sleep health. The correlation patterns also differed between co-op and class students, indicating that the relationships between these factors vary based on academic program type.</p>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>While our current analysis provides valuable insights into sleep patterns among college students, several opportunities exist to expand and enhance this research:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Additional Variables:</strong> Future studies could investigate other external factors such as Greek life participation, mental health indicators, or exercise habits, which may significantly influence sleep patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Institutional Data:</strong> Expanding our data collection beyond Northeastern University to include students from various colleges would allow us to investigate patterns across different academic environments and identify institution-specific trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Longitudinal Analysis:</strong> Tracking sleep patterns across academic terms or years could reveal how sleep habits evolve throughout a student's college career.</li>
            <li><strong>Deeper Analysis of Academic Performance:</strong> Including more granular measures of academic performance beyond GPA, such as performance in specific course types or time spent on different academic activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These enhancements would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between sleep, academic performance, and overall student well-being.</p>
